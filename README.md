thesis project in development
there is a temp video in the assets file. I will have a minimum of 2 video files and possibly 3 for the game.
The arduino is working on this sketch- so the hardware is communicating with the software.
The outline for the game is currently in this Google Doc - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hVQUhW1YzUbOEw4XCGaRTJ_OR644bRkqUsCRMM_VtEA/edit#slide=id.g135a239de59_0_92
